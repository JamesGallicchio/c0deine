# c0deine
c0deine is a reference compiler for c0. It is written in Lean 4, which allows us to express the formal semantics in the same language as the compiler itself.

Currently, we are working to target wasm. We plan to also target C, and x86 assembly.

No phases of the compiler are currently proven correct, but we are hoping to do so in the future.

## the name
"c0deine" is a reference to the major component of a street drug sometimes called "lean" (see, e.g., [here](https://americanaddictioncenters.org/codeine-addiction/cough-syrup)). the pun was hard to resist.

that said, opioid addiction is not a joke, and codeine is still one of the most commonly abused opioids. please reach out if the name makes you uncomfortable (we can change it).
